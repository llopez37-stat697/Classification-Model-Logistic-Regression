# Classification-Models

Here I will be applying best practices in order to determine the most effective and efficient model.

The following steps I will be taking are the following:

Step 1 – collect data

I will be downloading the two files from the Lending Club loans website for the years 2012-2014. 

Merging the data together into one dataframe. 

I will then make a table of the variable names. Make a table of the number of rows and columns in the dataframe.

Step 2 – exploring and preparing the data

I will summarize the important features of the data. Summarize some of the numeric and some of the categorical features, there may be too many to summarize.

I will create Training and Testing datasets. Use a 75-25 split. 

Step 3 – training a model on the data

Utilizing Logistic Regression

Step 4 – evaluating model performance

I will compute the accuracy and, if appropriate, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to rank the classification accuracy of each model.

Step 5 – improving model performance

By tuning the parameters
